"""
- space constant O(n)
- array has linear run time 
- in the worst case insert operation has a linear run time, because if you insert in index 0 you run the entire array giving the old content new index values. Also has a constant space
- appending is a constant run time and space (always insert in the end of an array)
- extend insert an array in other array by doing a series of append operations 
- Delete has a linear run time in the worst scenario, same logic as insert
